# Project 1: Introduction to Snap! -- Drawing with Sprites
## Project Name: SpriteDraw

### Objective
In this project you will become familiar with the Snap! Programming environment while learning how to create Sprites (the objects that Snap! users add code to create programs) and then manipulate those sprites and use them to draw on the stage (screen/program area).

### Assignments
1. Follow the Mouse Pointer
   1. Have the default sprite follow the mouse pointer
   1. Bonus: Only follow the sprite when the mouse button is down
   1. Put pen down and follow mouse pointer
   1. Change the pen color of the sprite
1. Follow Another Sprite
   1. Create a second sprite and make it follow the default sprite
   1. Keep creating sprites, each one following the one before it (Make a snake of sprites)
1. Make a Sprite that moves around the screen autonomously (on its own - it can move in any way that you want/program it to) -- Learn about the bounce command
   1. Make another (one, or two or as many as you want) sprite(s) that follows the Sprite that moves around on its own.
1. Move Using Keystrokes
   1. Make a sprite move by pressing keystrokes (eg: up arrow, down arrow, left arrow, and right arrow)
   1. Write Your Initials using your program
1. Draw a Diagonal Line - program a sprite to draw a diagonal line without user intervention
   1. Change the default color of the pen
   1. Change the default thickness of the pen
   1. Draw an X (Two Diagonals)
   1. Draw an X in two places on the stage

### Bonus Assignments
1. Write your initials using a program, not user control
   1. Can you extend your program to be able to draw the letters in different sizes?
1. Draw Your Name Programmatically (not user drawn)
1. Extend your program so it can draw any word simply by typing in the word.
