# Project 2: Pong

### Objective
In this project you will learn to use conditionals and build a basic game with the skills learned so far. The techniques and concepts involved in this project are used in all games from here on out, and can and will be applied to future coding projects.

### Description
In this assignment you will be coding up the video game Pong. Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games created by Atari. It is based on table tennis featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. Your final game will need to have two “paddles” that users control to move up and down trying to block/hit the “ball” back and forth. A player scores when the opposing player misses the ball and it goes off the screen. The ball must travel in straight lines bouncing off of the top and bottom of the screen and off of the paddles. You should keep score for each player and display that score and code up an end/winning case. 

### Assignments
1. Make an Up-Down Move Game
   1. If up arrow pressed, move up
   1. Else, move down
1. Create BounceAround
   1. One player on side of screen that moves up and down
   1. A ball should bounce off of the three walls of the screen and the paddle, but should restart if it gets by the player’s paddle
   1. (Bonus) Keep a Score
1. Create Pong
   1. Build game with two player controlled paddles
   1. Ball bounces between paddles and off walls
   1. Keep Score
   1. Create a custom theme for your game (air hockey, space theme, etc).

### Bonus Assignments
1. Make Barriers to bounce off of in the middle of the screen
1. Make another ball bounce around as well
1. Crazy Pong - Make the ball move in something other than straight lines - you will need to include in comments how your ball moves/behaves
1. Make your own custom bounce function
   1. Make it simulate actual bouncing, exiting at the angle mirrored to its entry
   1. Can you make it universal to any sprite
   1. Create a Bounce that works on top and bottom of screen
1. Make a CPU for one of the paddles
1. Make a Custom Scoreboard that doesn’t use the built-in variable display (Showing Variable on screen)
