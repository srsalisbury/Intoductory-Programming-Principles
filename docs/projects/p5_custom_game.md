# Project 5: Custom Game

## Objectives
This project will allow people to show what they have learned in the previous four projects and apply it to a game of their choosing. The game they choose will be graded based on in-class effort and code readability. Hopefully the game they choose involves some complexity, so they will have reason to work on it during class and during the break if they want to.

## Description
In this assignment you will have to make a requirements specifications document for your game, and I will grade your game based on how it is similar to the game and if it meets all of your criteria. This means that you have some say in how your game will be graded. If your specifications document is not good enough, I will help you make it better.
