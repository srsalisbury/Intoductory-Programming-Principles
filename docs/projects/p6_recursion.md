# Project 6: Recursion

## Objectives
This project will allow students to demonstrate their knowledge of the structure and use of recursion in programming. They will work on either a fractal drawing program or a tree drawing program that utilizes recursion to complete the task. 

## Description
In this project you will have to choose to make either a fractal drawing function or a tree drawing function. The fractal function will make a Koch’s Snowflake initially, and if the student demonstrates a complex and solid understanding of recursion and fractals, they will be allowed to make their own fractal after they are done. For the tree, the function will make a tree with a given branch value, or how many branches for each iteration. Again, if the student demonstrates a complex understanding, they will be allowed to create either a Koch’s Snowflake or other fractal recursive function.

### Assignments
1. Choose One:
   1. Tree Function
      1. Must have input
         1. Branch number
         1. Final branch length
      1. Must utilize recursion
         1. Calls itself within the function
         1. Has an end case
   1. Fractal Function
      1. Must have input
         1. Levels of detail
      1. Must utilize recursion
         1. Calls itself within the function
         1. Has an end case

### Bonus Assignments
1. Fractal Function
   1. Choose any other fractal than a Koch Snowflake
   1. Identify a function for creating the levels of detail in that fractal
   1. Implement that algorithm in a recursive function similar to above
      1. Inputs
      1. Levels of detail
