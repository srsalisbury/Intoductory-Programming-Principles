# Project 7: Sort

## Objectives
This project will allow students to demonstrate their ability to read a requirement specifications document and write a readable program based on it. It will also allow students to show their understanding of algorithms and classes.

## Description 
In this project you will be tasked with implementing Bubble Sort, a common and simple sorting algorithm that is a good starting point for more complex algorithms. You will be given a description and examples of how Bubble Sort works, but you will not be shown any code. Then, you will have to implement Bubble Sort in the language given, so that it can be shown to the instructor. A graphical system will be provided for you, so all you need to worry about is the algorithm and implementation. For advanced students, requirement specs for Quick Sort and Merge Sort are available if they want a more challenging algorithm to make.

### Assignments
1. Bubble Sort
   1. Must work on any given list length
      1. Lists of random length will be provided to test the algorithm
   1. Must use given visual interface
   1. Must show sound understanding of program readability and tradeoffs
      1. There are no perfect tradeoffs, anything that demonstrates thought will be great

### Bonus Assignments
1. Quick Sort
   1. Same requirements as Bubble Sort
1. Merge Sort
   1. Same requirements as Bubble Sort
